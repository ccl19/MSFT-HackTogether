# MSFT-HackTogether
Nexus-AI focussed submission

# What is our product?
Our submission is a teams tab application that links to our website focussed on student productivity.
We have implemented Microsoft OpenAI in a variety of places in our design in ways that cut down on the time spend by students in their day to day life.
Our submission is focussing on the Application Tracker, the File Summariser and the ToDo Chatbot sections of Nexus as they are the key areas where AI has been implemented to a high useage.
