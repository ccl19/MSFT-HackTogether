# MSFT-HackTogether
Nexus-AI focussed submission

# What is our product?
Our submission is a teams tab application that links to our website focusing on student productivity.
We have implemented Microsoft OpenAI in a variety of places in our design in ways that cut down on the time spent by students in their day-to-day life.
Our submission is focussing on the Application Tracker, the File Summarizer and the ToDo Chatbot sections of Nexus as they are the key areas where AI has been implemented to high usage.

# Application Tracker



# File Summarizer
Our revolutionary File Summariser tool leverages the cutting-edge capabilities of Microsoft Graph, empowering users to select and upload any file type, including Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, and PDFs, directly from their OneDrive. Moreover, the tool offers the flexibility to upload PDF files from local storage, ensuring seamless accessibility. Powered by the advanced Azure OpenAI platform, our tool processes the text extracted from the uploaded files, dissecting it into concise and digestible fragments. By employing a designed custom prompt, our tool generates summaries optimized for academic purposes. These summaries strike an impeccable balance, providing university students with the necessary depth to comprehend the core concepts within the material while preserving an unparalleled level of conciseness that surpasses the original presentation's readability.
We acknowledge the paramount importance of efficient note-taking and seamless integration within the academic workflow. As a testament to this commitment, our File Summariser tool includes an exceptional featureâ€”seamless integration with Microsoft OneNote. With a single click, users can effortlessly upload the generated summaries to a dedicated section within their OneNote, empowering them to seamlessly incorporate these summaries into their existing notes. This exceptional integration streamlines the revision process, enabling students to navigate through their comprehensive notes with ease and efficiency, propelling them towards academic excellence.


# Chatbot
We have integrated Azure OpenAI into a chatbot which allows users to have a seamless interaction with a safe AI. We have included buttons which allow shortcuts within the chatbot. Creating a to-do list is easy when using the chatbot, simply type your plans for the day and allow our AI to help with timings and conveniently add them to your Microsoft Todo App. Another shortcut includes automatically displaying the weather in the user's location, our chatbot uses Weather APIs to retrieve weather information depending on the IP address location of users.
